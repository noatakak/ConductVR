General Notes:
	The UPNP function in the network.gd script will not be commented out unless
	we find that it somehow is activating itself without being called down the
	line. The function call is currently commented out on line 55 (as of 11/23/23)
	and will stay that way. This is just to show part of the trial and error
	process.
